# Vulnerability Management - Nessus

## Objective

In this Project I demonstrated MY ability to learn vulnerability scanning and vulnerability remediation. These are two of the main steps in the Vulnerability Management Lifecycle.I used Nessus Essentials to scan local VMs hosted on VMWare Workstation in order run credentialed scans to discover vulnerabilities, remediate some of the vulnerabilities, then perform a rescan to verify remediation. 

### Skills Learned
1- Installed and configured Nessus Essentials to perform credentialed vulnerability scans against Windows 10 Hosts
2- Implemented Vulnerability Management Function on sandbox networks: Discover, Prioritize, Assess, Report, Remediate, Verify
3- Conducted vulnerability assessments with Nessus; remediated vulnerabilities
4- Developed automated remediation process to preemptively deal with vulnerabilities stemming from Windows updates and third-party software.
