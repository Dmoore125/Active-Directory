# Vulnerability Management - Nessus

## Objective

In this Project I demonstrated My ability to learn vulnerability scanning and vulnerability remediation. These are two of the main steps in the Vulnerability Management Lifecycle.I used Nessus Essentials to scan local VMs hosted on VMWare Workstation in order run credentialed scans to discover vulnerabilities, remediate some of the vulnerabilities, then perform a rescan to verify remediation.

## Key Takeaways from Project 
Non-Credential scans = Quick and fast - not thorough 
Credentials Scans = Longer and slower - much more thorough 

### Skills Learned
1. Installed and configured Nessus Essentials to perform credentialed vulnerability scans against Windows 10 Hosts
2. Implemented Vulnerability Management Function on sandbox networks: Discover, Prioritize, Assess, Report, Remediate, Verify
3. Conducted vulnerability assessments with Nessus; remediated vulnerabilities
4. Developed automated remediation process to preemptively deal with vulnerabilities stemming from Windows updates and third-party software.

### Tools Used
VMWare, Nessus, Microsoft 10 Iso File creator,Command Prompt

## Steps
1.  Install VMWare Player
2.  Download Windows 10 ISO
3.  Download and Install Nessus Essentials
4.  Setup Virtual Machine
5.  Ensure connectivity with VM
6.  Create a new scan in Nessus
7.  Inspecting the first scan (no credentials)
8.  Configuring VM for credentialed scans
9.  First scan with credentials
10. Inspecting First scan with credentials results
11. Installing a deprecated Firefox on our VM
12. Inspect scan results after installing deprecated firefox
13. Remediating some vulnerabilities
14.  Inspect scan results after remediating some vulnerabilities
